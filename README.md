# SQLPROJECT8
The main goal was to practice modularizing SQL logic by creating reusable code blocks.
For this task, I used MySQL Workbench to write and test two key items:
A Stored Procedure (GetProductsByCategory) that takes a category name and returns all products in that category.
A Function (CountProductsByCategory) that takes a category name and returns the total number of products in it.
